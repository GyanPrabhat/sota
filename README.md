## <span style = "color:blue"> Title </span> : Generative AI : An Overview

### **_By_** : Gyan Prabhat
### **Supervisor**: [Dr. Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/) <br>

#### Overview
We are in the era of Generative Artifical Intelligence (AI). With the paradigm shift of just looking for the patterns in the data, we have took a step forward where want to generate brand new data instances based on the patetterns we have learnt from the given data. Deep Generative Modelling can be considered as a particular subset of Deep Learning where the end objective is always to generate brand new data.
