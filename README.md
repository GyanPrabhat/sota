#### Overview
We are in the era of Generative Artifical Intelligence (AI). With the paradigm shift of just looking for the patterns in the data, we have took a step forward where want to generate brand new data instances based on the patetterns we have learnt from the given data. Deep Generative Modelling can be considered as a particular subset of Deep Learning where the end objective is always to generate brand new data.
